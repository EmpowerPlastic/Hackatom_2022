# Hackatom_2022

Our initial idea was to create work with eco credits on regen network using interchain accounts so that you could
create a presale funding mechanism for other chains over IBC and ICA.

We quickly realized that Regen was a bit too far behind on the IBC version and after a quick attempt to upgrade it we decided to create our own chain for this purpose.

To make the challenge a bit more interesting, we decided to use the DAO_UP contract as the basis, meaning we would do Interchain Accounts over CosmWasm.
